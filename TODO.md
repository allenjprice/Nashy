#TODO
- no original key works besides C, apparently

- rename divs with some formula: "key-select-group", for instance
- div around the two textareas called 'text-area-group' or something like that (keep a top-level name with the inside elements), give it a max-width property
- size textareas with css instead of rows/col attributes
- so, give each textarea item like 45% width and a max-height (with room for padding)
- oh, when you set a max-height to the text areas, add overflow auto to get scrollbars if it overflows the page
- alphabetize css by selector (sort command in sublime)
- comment block in top of js: app title, version number (0.1.0), url to github, your name, and some personal link
- prefer diatonic chords
- make pretty
